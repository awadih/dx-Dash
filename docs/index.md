**dx-Dash** is a basic serverless application retrieving weather data through [Weather-API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) calls.

Media used by the application such as maps, photos and icons has been collected through 
[Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) API calls as well
as from the [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) website.

This documentation is written in the purpose of keeping up with the development workload. Furthermore, it should help 
understand better the APIs features in order to make free of charge API calls per user session.

In other to structure the project development, we highlight the following work process:

1. Research
2. Prototyping: Prototyping involves creating an interactive model or representation of the website or application to 
simulate its functionality. [Inkscape as a wireframing-tool]
3. Design: Design in web development involves creating the visual and functional aspects of a website or application. 
It encompasses the overall look and feel, user interface (UI), user experience (UX), layout, color schemes, typography, 
and graphic elements. [Bootstrap, awesome-font?]
4. Development: using [Flask Framework]
5. Testing: using [Pytest]
6. Release: Deployment using the web hosting platform [render](https://render.com/).
7. Maintenance
