Media used by the application such as maps, photos and icons has been collected through Google Maps and Unsplash API calls as well as from the Icons8 website.

This documentation is written in the purpose of keeping up with the development workload. Furthermore, it should help understand better the APIs features in order to make free of charge API calls per user session.
