# Security Policy

Being busy with other projects and personal life, no security policy is taken into account so far. I will focus more in the future on it. Feel free to help out, as this project is open-sourced.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
|         |                    |
|         |                    |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
